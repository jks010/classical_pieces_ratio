# classical_pieces_ratio

Read somewhere that some composers had more ink than blank spaces in their sheets ("too many notes", Amadeus)
So I've wrote a little script to check if a classical piece has more ink than blank

# modus operandi : 
- Pass an Image as an Argument when executing the Python file.

Ex : Python ratio.py PaganiniCaprice.jpg
